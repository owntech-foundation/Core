    GPIO pins exposed on OwnTech Spin headers.

    The OwnTech Spin board provides 6 headers:
    * 3 around the external egde of the board,
    * 4 within the board.

    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * A 20-pin header on the external left of the board, numbered from 1 to 20 top to bottom.
      Pins 3, 8, 13 and 18 are GND, thus not exposed in this binding.
    * A 20-pin header on the external right of the board, numbered from 21 to 40 bottom to top.
      Pins 23, 28, 33 and 38 are GND, while pins 36, 39 and 40 are voltage, thus not
      exposed in this binding.
    * A 5-pin header on the internal top left of the board, numbered from 41 to 45.
    * A 7-pin header on the internal bottom left of the board, numbered from 46 to 52.
    * A 6-pin header on the bottom of the board, numbered from 53 to 58.
      Pins 54 and 57 are GND, thus not exposed in this binding.
    * A 1-pin header on the internal bottom right of the board, numbered 59.


    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 46 pins.
    Pins not described in this map are displayed between curly brackets.
