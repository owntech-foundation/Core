description : This parent node is for setting general parameters such as the hardware version
              (i.e. the board you are using) and the switching frequency.

compatible : "power-leg"

properties :

  frequency :
    type : int
    required : true
    description : Switching frequency in Hz (this frequency must be same for all the timer !)

child-binding:

  description : In power electronics, a "leg" typically refers to a section of a power converter circuit responsible
                for controlling the flow of electrical power. A leg comprises two semiconductor devices like transistors
                (e.g., IGBTs or MOSFETs) and diodes. Control of a power leg involves precisely switching the semiconductor
                devices on and off to regulate voltage or current. In this child node, you can choose the timing unit of the HRTIM
                to generate the PWM which will control your IGBT/MOSFET.

  properties :

    leg-name :
      type : string
      required : true
      description : name of the leg, choose freely but the name must be different between each legs.

    pwm-pin-num :
      type : int
      required : true
      description : pin number where you want to start a pwm. Choose a pin number and its complementary will
                    also be set. E.G. in the case of stm32G4 mcu unit, if you want to start a PWM in GPIO PA8
                    choose pwm-pin-num = 12 and its complementary at PA9 (pin number 14) will also start.

    current-pin-num :
      type : int
      required : true
      description : Current mode is used to control the output current. We use a comparator and DAC generation
                    for slope compensation. The availability of the current mode depends on the pin connected
                    to the current measure.
