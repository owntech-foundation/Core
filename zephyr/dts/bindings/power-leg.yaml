child-binding:

  description : In power electronics, a "leg" typically refers to a section of a power converter
                circuit responsible for controlling the flow of electrical power. A leg comprises
                two semiconductor devices like transistors (e.g., IGBTs or MOSFETs) and diodes.
                Control of a power leg involves precisely switching the semiconductor
                devices on and off to regulate voltage or current. In this child node,
                you can choose the timing unit of the HRTIM to generate the PWM which will control
                your semiconductor/IGBT/MOSFET.

      description : name of the leg, choose freely but the name must be different between
