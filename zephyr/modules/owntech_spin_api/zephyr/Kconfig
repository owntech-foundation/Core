		The SPIN API is a module that aggregates all the drivers of
		the STM32G474RE of the Spin board within a single object.
		This abstracts base drivers by providing an object-based,

			It also interfaces with the Twist shield, providing	ways to
			interact with the sensors available on the shield and converting
			raw data in their relevant unit.
