!!! note ""
    An ADC, or Analog-to-Digital Converter, is a device that turns analog signals, like sound or temperature, into digital data that a computer or microcontroller can understand. It measures the analog voltage and converts it into a digital value that can be used by digital systems for processing, storage, or display.

## Pinout

SPIN boards have 5 independant ADC units. Each unit can measure multiple analog signals, using a measurment sequence.

!!! abstract "Capabilities"
    Each ADC channel has :  
    -  12 bit resolution: 0b to 4096b  
    -  Sensing full scale: 0V to 2.048V  
    -  Sampling time down to 42ns

    ![SPIN_1_0_0_ADC_pinout_inner](images/SPIN_1.0.0_inner_adc.png){ width=243 }


!!! info 
    ADC12 means that the pin can be used either as ADC1 or ADC2

## Channel sequence

Each ADC unit can measure multiple analog signal. This works by defining an acquisition sequence. 

!!! tip
    By default the aquisition sequence is in continuous mode. It means than one trigger will trigger all the sequence of acquisition. 
    This can be changed using [Discontinuous Mode](#continuous-discontinuous-sequence)

!!! example 
    === "3 channels on ADC1"
    ```c++
    spin.adc.enableChannel(1, 2)
    spin.adc.enableChannel(1, 3)
    spin.adc.enableChannel(1, 1)
    ```
    In this example, for each trigger action, the ADC1 will measure channel 2, then channel 3, then channel 1.

    === "Single channel"
    ```spin.adc.enableChannel(1, 1)```

    In this example, for each trigger, the ADC1 will measure  channel 1.

!!! note 
    Sequence order is given by `spin.adc.enableChannel()` order.

## Software triggered

=== " "
    ![adc software triggers](images/ADC_software_trigger.svg){ width=300 align=left }

    A software trigger for an ADC is a command or signal generated by the software to start the ADC conversion process. Instead of using a hardware signal or event to initiate the conversion, the ADC is triggered by software instructions, allowing for precise control and synchronization with other software processes or events. For example this trigger command can be generated from a high speed control task.

    ```C++
    spin.adc.configureTriggerSource(2, software); // ADC 2 configured in software mode
    data.triggerAcquisition(2); // Send an adc trigger to ADC2 to start conversion
    adc_value = data.getLatest(2, 35); // Get the acquired data
    ```

    !!! example 
        See the following example for an application :

## Synchronous with PWMs

Software triggers is generally speaking not suitable for applications that requires precise timing. 
Sometimes measurement have to be taken at a specific time, in interaction with the control signal. 

!!! info
    This kind of acquisition have a side benefit. It operates in the background and does not interfer with software. 
    It means that periodical sampling will not interrupt code execution. 

The trigger is the PWM peripheral, the ADC performs the conversion and place the result in an output buffer, the output buffer is directly placed in memory by a DMA. A rather complex software mechanics execute periodically and serve each measurement in a dedicated memory space. The periodical routine is executed at the beggining of the controlTask. 

!!! info 
    Synchronous measurement require having a controlTask running. 

!!! tip 
    This page informs on how to parameters the triggering of the measurement
    To retrieve measurement values please refer to DataAPI 

The section below explain how to synchronize measurements with control signals.

!!! note
    These features are available for ADC1 and ADC2.

### Linking ADC and PWM channel

ADC1 and ADC2 can be associated with PWM channels at will.
